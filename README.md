phase 1 WK3 Code Challenge

## Introduction
This small app adds items to a list, clears them and indicates if they are purchased or not.

## Functions
1. Create list items
    The first function adds items in the list and also ads an [Id] [#item] to be able to target the items easier with the clear button to be added later.

2. Add list items
    The second function is to add items to the list from the [inputfield]. All items the user keys in will appear in the form of a [ul] list. They appear with an [id] to be able to target them specifically.

3. Purchase list items
    The third function is to mark items as being purchased. I achieve this by addding a [strike] through element onto the text to be able to mark them as purchsed.

4. Clear list items
    The last function is to clear our list as there needs to be a way to refresh our list without reloading the page. This can be done by using our [#item] id to clear our list and allow the user to start over.

# Conclusion
This app is a simple one and does not have alot of styling, but we can make it more complex using css or some bootstrap. I will continue to update as we go.
